Very early version of an endless mode for Kaycees Mod.

Only way to end the run is to manually end it or to lose.

## Features
- Run only ends when you lose
- Added stats to pause menu and end run starts screen
- Works with custom final bosses
- Pelts continuously get more expensive


## Configs

    - How many regions between bosses
    - How many bosses between final bosses
- Add start new endless run UI to customize your Run
